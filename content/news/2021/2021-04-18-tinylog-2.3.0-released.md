I'm happy to announce the release of the next feature update of tinylog 2 within the usual half-yearly rhythm! The final release version 2.3.0 includes the same set of features as the second milestone. All new features are described in detail in the news posts of the [first milestone](2021/02/first-milestone-of-tinylog-2.3-is-out/) and [second milestone](2021/03/second-milestone-of-tinylog-2.3-is-out/).

Additionally, the new release version includes a few performance optimizations. The [updated benchmark](benchmark) compares the performance of tinylog 2.3.0 with all relevant Java logging benchmarks. Now, there are even three different benchmarks for different log format patterns with distinct caller information.
