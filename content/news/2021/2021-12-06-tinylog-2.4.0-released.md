I'm happy to announce the second big release of tinylog for 2021: The final version 2.4.0 of tinylog there! As usual, the final release includes the same set of features as the [first](2021/04/first-milestone-of-tinylog-2.4-is-out/) and [second milestone](2021/11/second-milestone-of-tinylog-2.4-is-out/). All new features and bug fixes are described in detail in the linked news posts of both milestones.

Additionally, tinylog 2.4.0 supports the latest alpha 5 of SLF4J 2.0 now. Previous alpha versions of SLF4J 2.0 may be incompatible.
