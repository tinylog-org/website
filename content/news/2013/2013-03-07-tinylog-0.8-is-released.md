Today the second to last beta version of tinylog is released. The new version 0.8 is now available for [download](download).

New features:

* Maven artifact
* OSGi bundle (e.g. for Eclipse RCP applications)
* Support for application servers such as Glassfish
* Separated logger and configuration (two different classes)
* Fluent API for configuration
* New configurations can be set atomically (multiple changes become simultaneously active)
* Observe properties files and reload the configuration automatically
* Extended the logging API for other logging frameworks (necessary for the planned log4j facade)
* Logging methods for plain Java objects
* Complete rewriting of tests (now 155 tests with a code coverage of 94 %)

Performance:

* Use the fast method sun.reflect.Reflection.getCallerClass() to get the class name in Sun/Oracle VMs
* Faster creating of log entries, if no parameters are passed

Bug fixes:

* Logging writers get the logging level of the logger instead of the logging entry
* Labellers are ignored if defined by property
