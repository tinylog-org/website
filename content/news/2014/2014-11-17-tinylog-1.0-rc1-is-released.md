The first release candidate of tinylog 1.0 is released and can be [downloaded](download). Thereby tinylog is feature complete and the API is declared as stable. From now on, there will only bug fixes until the major release.

* Writing of log entries has been sped up
* New syntax of parameters in logging messages: `Logger.info("Divide {} by {}", a, b)`. This change is incompatible with previous beta versions and such logging messages have to be migrated for tinylog 1.0.
