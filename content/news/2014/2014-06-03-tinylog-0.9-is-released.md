The version 0.9 of tinylog is ready and can be [downloaded](download). This is the last beta version and all the essential features are implemented. The next version will be the first release candidate and contain only minor changes.

New features:

* New placeholders "{class_name}", "{package}", "{pid}" (process ID) and "{thread_id}" for logging format pattern
* New syntax for setting logging levels for individual packages (e.g. tinylog.level@com.example = trace)
* Multiple instances of an application can simultaneously write to the same log file
* Support of multiple processes by FileWriter and RollingFileWriter
* ProcessIdLabeler for RollingFileWriter to create an own log file for each instance of an application by using the process ID
* Optionally buffered writing
* Support of custom logging levels for specific classes
* More detailed output of errors and misconfigurations
* Logging writer for SQL databases
* New policy to limit the the number of log entries per file
* Support for multiple logging writers (e.g. for simultaneous output to the console and to a log file)

Java 8:

* tinylog uses the new internal API of Java 8 as well, if this will be much faster or saves memory
