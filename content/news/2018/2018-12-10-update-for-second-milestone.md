The version 2.0.0-M2.1 contains two fixes for the second milestone. tinylog can correctly parse parameters for multiple policies for rolling file writer now (see [issue 84](https://github.com/tinylog-org/tinylog/issues/84)). In addition, animal sniffer annotations are not a required Maven dependency anymore.
