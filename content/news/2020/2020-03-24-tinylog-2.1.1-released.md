With tinylog 2.0.1, the first preparations began to support tinylog as logging framework in GraalVM native images. Thanks to [shoneslab's](https://github.com/shoneslab) tests and [reported issues](https://github.com/tinylog-org/tinylog/issues/145), tinylog finally fully supports logging in GraalVM native images. A working example project can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/tinylog-org/tinylog-graal-example).
