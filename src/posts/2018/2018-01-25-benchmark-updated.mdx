title: Benchmark updated
---

In the [benchmark](/benchmark/), all logging frameworks have been updated to the latest version. tinylog 1.3.2 is a few milliseconds faster than the previous version 1.2. Log4j 2.10 has become much slower (up to 2 seconds) compared to version 2.8 and sometimes loses a few log entries. Ideas and suggestions on how to optimize the [configuration](/v2/configuration/) are welcome.
