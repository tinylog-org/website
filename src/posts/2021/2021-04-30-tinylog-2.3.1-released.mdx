title: tinylog 2.3.1 released
---

The first update of tinylog 2.3 fixes a problem with BOMs for UTF-16 and UTF-32. In previous versions, tinylog added a BOM for each log entry in a log file when UTF-16 or UTF-32 was used as charset encoding. Now, tinylog 2.3.1 inserts correctly a BOM for both charsets only at the beginning of a log file.
