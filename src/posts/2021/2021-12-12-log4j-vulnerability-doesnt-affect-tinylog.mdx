title: Log4j vulnerability doesn't affect tinylog
---

Due to the critical vulnerability [CVE-2021-44228](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-44228) in Log4j 2.14.1 and prior, I receive questions about the relevance to tinylog. The good news is that tinylog 1 and 2 are not affected. tinylog does not depend on Log4j 2. Both projects do not share any source code. tinylog is an independent logging framework and does not use JNDI.
