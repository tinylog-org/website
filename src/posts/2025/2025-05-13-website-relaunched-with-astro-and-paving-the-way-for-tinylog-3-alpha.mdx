title: Website relaunched with Astro and paving the way for tinylog 3 alpha
---

The tinylog.org website has undergone a significant upgrade by migrating the Content Management System from Hugo to Astro. Both are open-source static site generators.

This change was primarily driven by a desire for a more intuitive and flexible development experience. While Hugo has served me well and impressed with its performance, I found its template language challenging, particularly when it came to creating and managing a website that effectively supports two distinct versions of tinylog: the current v2 and the upcoming v3. Astro's component-based architecture and modern TypeScript tooling offer a more streamlined approach for my needs.

More importantly, this migration to Astro as my CMS lays the crucial groundwork for the long-awaited release of the first alpha version of tinylog 3! I know many of you have been expecting this, and I'm thrilled to share that the core development for the first alpha of tinylog 3 is already complete. You can take a sneak peek at the GitHub repository on the [tinylog v3.0 branch](https://github.com/tinylog-org/tinylog/tree/v3.0).

The final step before I can officially release the alpha version is to migrate the documentation for tinylog 3. Once this is complete, I'll be ready to roll out the alpha.

I've worked hard to ensure a smooth transition with the new website, but as with any major change, there might be a few wrinkles. If you encounter anything that seems to be out of place, please let me know. You can report any issues on the website's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/tinylog-org/website/issues), or send an email directly to [martin@tinylog.org](mailto:martin@tinylog.org).

I'm excited about these developments and look forward to sharing tinylog 3 with you soon.
