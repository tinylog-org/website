title: New website
---

The new website of tinylog is online! Before, the website was based on [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/). Now, the website is based on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). The static site generator generates the tinylog website from the new GitHub repository [tinylog-org/website](https://github.com/tinylog-org/website). There, all content exists as Markdown and is generated into static HTML pages. This has the advantage that everyone can edit all content directly on GitHub. Also, the web pages are delivered faster now, because there is no PHP or other code to run on the server side.

As part of the changeover, I also revised the layout and start page. However, the overall content and structure of the website has remained the same. If you notice any issues, please feel free to file an issue or pull request on [tinylog-org/website](https://github.com/tinylog-org/website).
