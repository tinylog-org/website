title: tinylog 2.5.0 released
---

I'm proud to announce the release of tinylog 2.5.0! As usual, the final release includes the same set of features as the [first](/2022/03/first-milestone-of-tinylog-2.5-is-out/) and [second milestone](/2022/05/second-milestone-of-tinylog-2.5-is-out/). All new features and bug fixes are described in detail in the linked news posts of both milestones.

Special thanks to [f4lco](https://github.com/f4lco) for his generous donation to tinylog!
