title: 10 years tinylog
---

Exactly ten years ago, on January 23, 2012, the [first commit](https://github.com/tinylog-org/tinylog/commit/ea84b8258876ef557c3db71b8bb2b4eadb90f580) of tinylog was pushed. A lot has happened since then. In the same year, on August 9, 2012, the first public beta of tinylog was released. Three years later, on August 1, 2015, tinylog 1.0 was ready and four years later, tinylog 2.0 was already released.

At the beginning of tinylog, I was the only developer. Since then, a great community has emerged. People have started to write articles about tinylog, and more and more pull requests are created. By now, more new features are developed by the community than by myself. Thank you very much to everyone who has helped to make tinylog to the logging framework it is today!

Currently, tinylog 2.5 and 3.0 are being developed in parallel. tinylog 2.5 will be an iterative feature update for tinylog 2, whereas tinylog 3.0 is a complete rewrite of the logging framework with a more flexible and extensible core. Nonetheless, the logging API will be source-compatible with tinylog 2. tinylog 3.0 can be expected sometime next year. Stay tuned!
