title: First milestone of tinylog 2.8 is out
---

With the first milestone of version 2.8.0, tinylog offers the possibility to output all stored thread context values collectively without having to know the keys.

The placeholder `{context}` has been extended for this purpose.
Previously, the placeholder with the syntax `{context: key}` always expected a key and then output the associated stored value.
Now the definition of a key is optional.
If the key is omitted, the placeholder outputs now all current entries of the thread-based context as key-value pairs in alphabetical order.

The complete documentation for using the context placeholder and others placeholders can be found in the [Format Pattern](/configuration/#format-pattern) chapter.
Many thanks to [Russell Hanneken](https://github.com/rhanneken) for further developing the context placeholder and writing the documentation!
