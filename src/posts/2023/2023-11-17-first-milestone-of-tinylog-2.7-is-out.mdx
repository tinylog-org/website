title: First milestone of tinylog 2.7 is out
---

The first milestone of tinylog 2.7 introduces a new writer for syslog servers. Now, tinylog can send log entries to syslog compatible servers out of the box!

Example syslog server configuration:

```properties
writer          = syslog
writer.level    = debug
writer.format   = {class}: {message}
writer.protocol = UDP
writer.host     = 192.168.0.1
writer.port     = 514
```

Detailed information and all configuration parameters for the new syslog writer can be found on the [configuration page](/v2/configuration/#syslog-writer). Many thanks to [Piotr Karlowicz](https://github.com/pkarlowicz), who developed the new writer.
